## Performance Analysis

In this section the performance comparison will be discussed
As shown as in the FIGURE 1. below "Performance Comparison"
The Model Hog performed worse than the YOLO Algorithm in Object detection
From Evaluating with the same dataset as shown in FIGURE 3. i observed that the SCM-HOG model
displays a quick training time as shown in the FIGURE 2. the training time is not displayed
but it observed it. Based on that observation SVM-HOG was concluded to be advantagious when
computational power is a concern, and deep learning algorithms such as YOLO will be optimal for performance purposes.
