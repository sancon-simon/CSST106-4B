## Introduction to Computer Vision and Image Processing
Computer vision is a field of AI that uses machine learning and neural networks to help computers interpret and derive meaningful information from digital images, videos, and other visual inputs. It builds on image processing techniques to analyze visual data, make recommendations, and take actions based on detected patterns or defects.

Image processing serves as a means of translation between the human visual system and digital imaging devices. The human visual system does not perceive the world in the same manner as digital detectors, with display devices imposing additional noise and bandwidth restrictions.

## Types of Image Processing Techniques

### Filtering

The goal of using filters is to modify or enhance image properties and/or to extract valuable information from the pictures such as edges, corners, and blobs. 

### Edge Detection

The goal of edge detection is to identify the most significant edges within an image or scene. These detected edges should be connected to form meaningful lines and boundaries.

### Segmentation

The goal of  segmentation  is to simplify and analyze images by separating them into different segments. This makes it easier for computers to understand the content of the image.

## Case Study Overview

### Application

An OCR program extracts and repurposes data from scanned documents, camera images and image-only PDFs. It singles out letters on the image, puts them into words, and then puts the words into sentences, thus enabling access to and editing of the original content. It also eliminates the wasted effort of redundant manual data entry.

### Challenges

OCR softwareâ€™s performance hinges on the quality of the source images or documents. Low-resolution images, faded text, or poor lighting conditions .this can be solved using Median filter by applying blur to noisy images while preserving the edges of high-contrast objects like letters with the help of binarization.

This OCR model addresses the poor lighting issues of captured image with different values of shadows, this pose a problem that can confuse the OCR system of the black and white values, this model utilizes the parameter adaptive_thresh_mean filter to binarize the image in an adaptive manner, this takes the average values of black and whites and set a threshold for them to normalize the photo.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```python

## Conclusion

Image processing is essential in computer vision, because computers does not perceive the world with the same quality as us,  Effective image processing enables AI systems to enhance and analyze images, extract meaningful information that be used to automate different tasks.

From this activity, i learned that image quality directly impacts computer vision model performance, and using techniques like filtering, edge detection and segmentation can significantly improve the accuracy of data extraction.

## Extension Activity
Research an Emerging Form of Image Processing

## Image processing evolution

The technique of improving the quality of digital images by manipulation, enhancement and analysis of captured photos to extract useful information, has evolved significantly over the years. Traditional techniques such as filtering, enhancement, and segmentation paved the way for a more advance methods. Today, image processing encompasses a wide range of operations, including noise reduction, edge detection, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. With the rise of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized image processing, enabling tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.

## Potential Impact

The impact of image processing and computer vision are transforming various industries. For example in the fields of healthcare, they assist with diagnosing diseases, planning treatments, and guiding surgeries with the help of advanced imaging techniques. For autonomous vehicles, these technologies let cars to see their environments, detect obstacles, and drive smoothly. Finally In manufacturing, image processing helps ensure the quality of the products by automatically inspecting and detecting damages.
