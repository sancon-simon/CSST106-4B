## Performance Analysis

##
The inference time of yolo detection is averaging in 1.5 seconds 
While the accuracy is quite promising considering the confidence score is alway above 90.

This capability of yolos singles pass detection is quite impressive, 
In single-pass detection where the ability of YOLO to analyze an entire image in one go, 
Rather than processing it in multiple stages or passes.
This can be impactful for real time object detection when response is crucial for a better performance output.
